Cournol is a GTK+ based application for analyzing absolute supply
monopolies and polypolies. The program calculates the most important
data points for these market types, such as maximum profit, and draws the
respective graphs.

The library "nxpgtkdatabox" is an implementation of NxpRuler (by Gustavo
J. A. M. Carneiro, contained in gnumexp 0.11, http://numexp.org/) in the
GtkDatabox library (by Dr. Roland Bock, http://www.eudoxos.de/gtk/gtkdatabox/).
The file "patches/gtkdatabox.diff" contains the changes of GtkDatabox.
The NxpRuler library was not modified.
GtkDatabox and NxpRuler are released under the LGPL (see COPYING.LIB). Thus,
"nxpgtkdatabox", also complies with the terms of the LGPL.
However, the actual program "cournol" is released under the terms of the GPL
(see COPYING).

Cournol depends on GTK+ >= 2.10.0, so you have to install the
appropriate development packages.

The name of the program is derived from the French economist, philosopher and
mathematician "Antoine Augustin Cournot", and the suffix "-ol" of the German
words "Monopol" (English: monopoly), as well as "Polypol" (English: polypoly).

The icon of cournol shows Cournot's face. 

The file scripts/Lindent is a shell script which was taken from the Linux
kernel 2.6.15 archive (see http://www.kernel.org/). The scripts uses the GNU
tool indent for formatting the source code.

An Inno Setup script is located in scripts/cournol.iss
